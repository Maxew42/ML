Content :
* Notebooks :
  * Train : This notebook can be use to train a pretrained faster rccn model on a specific dataset.
  * Load and execute Model : This notebook is a walk-through presenting how to load a saved model and perform prediction on images in a dataset.

  * Saved model and datasets : More informations on the purpose of these folders can be found in the [main readme](https://github.com/Maxew42/ML).
