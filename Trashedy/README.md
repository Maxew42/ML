# Trashedy

Repository for the Trashedy project. A five weeks school project aiming to develop a ML object detection model to help map river litter.

## Authors

- Maximilien Dufau
- Benoit Claudic
- Rémi Legrand
- Luc Manceau
- Amélie Jond

We used Pytorch 1.9.0 as the main Deep Learning library.

## Content

The project is divided in two main parts :

- The "production" part with the website and the integrated ML model.
- The research part with notebooks used to train and test the model.

### ml-models-environment

* Notebooks :
  * Train : This notebook can be use to train a pretrained faster rccn model on a specific dataset.
  * Load and execute Model : This notebook is a walk-through presenting how to load a saved model and perform prediction on images in a dataset.

* Saved model and datasets : More informations on the purpose of these folders can be found in the [main readme](https://github.com/Maxew42/ML).
